# L-Measure
1.	Use MinGW for GCC/G++ compiler for windows
    *	Setup L-Measure code on GCC/G++ compiler
    *	GCC/G++ for windows is provide by many vendors like CYGWIN, MinGW and others.
    *	This manual will help setting up L-Measure on MinGW - A C/C++ compiler suite which allows you to create Windows executables       without any dependency on external DLLs besides the normal MSVC runtimes.
    *	MinGW is a Windows port of the GNU compiler tools, like GCC, Make, Bash, etc, which run directly in Windows without any          emulation layer. By default it will compile to a native Win32 target, complete with .exe and .dll files.

2.	Generate L-Measure executable on Eclipse CDT for windows
    *	Download Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers from    http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers-includes-incubating-components/indigosr1
    *	Copy the zip into any desired location and unzip it.
    *	Download MinGW from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
    *	Install the MinGW with at least c and c++ options.
    *	Restart your machine.
    *	Go the eclipse folder, and click the eclipse icon. Choose a desired workspace location
    *	Once the IDE is launched, go to the workbench.
    *	Right click on the project explorer and go to New->Projects->C++ Project
    *	Select Project Type: Empty Project & Tool chains: MinGW GCC and select the project name “Lm” and click finish.
    *	A new empty project is created.
    *	Copy the code to your local drive from file server or where ever you have.
    *	Right click on Lm (project in the project explorer @ eclipse IDE) and navigate to Import->File System. Browse to the    folder having the code. Select all the files to be imported.
    *	Right click on the Lm (project in the project explorer @ eclipse IDE) and navigate to  Properties->C/C++ Build->Settings->Tool Settings -> MinGW c++ Linker -> Miscellaneous 
    *	In the Linker Flags add “-static-libgcc -static-libstdc++” and Apply and OK. 
    *	This  step is done in order to package the required GCC library dll with the executable.(Ref#3.2)
    *	In the same window (opened from Step#m), go to C/C++ Build -> Settings ->Tool Settings -> MinGW c++ Linker. Replace the Command: “g++” with “g++ -Wl,--stack,4194304”. Apply and Ok.
    *	This change helps us to increase the stack size to 4Mb from 1Mb.
    *	Right click and Build Project
    *	Remove error and rebuild in case of errors.
    *	Find the executable in the debug folder of the project.
3.	Setup Eclipse for Linux
      *	Download the desired eclipse package from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers-includes-incubating-components/indigosr2
      *	Extract the downloaded  package
      *	Click on eclipse icon to open the IDE, and select workbench.
      *	Now make a new project File->New->C++ Project.
      *	Select Project Type: Empty Project & Toolchains: Linux GCC. Give a Project name : lmeasure and then click finish.
      *	Copy the code from the file server to the local machine.
      *	Right click on the project lmeasure and select import.
      *	Select File System and click Next.
      *	Select the directory, where the code is being copied.
      *	Select the files and click on finish.
      *	Go to Project->Build All to build the project.
